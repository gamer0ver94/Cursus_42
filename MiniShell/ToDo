READLINE()
DESCRIPTION         top

       readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
       prompt as a prompt.  If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no
       prompt is issued.  The line returned is allocated with malloc(3);
       the caller must free it when finished.  The line returned has the
       final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains.

       readline offers editing capabilities while the user is entering
       the line.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to
       those of emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also
       available.

       This manual page describes only the most basic use of readline.
       Much more functionality is available; see The GNU Readline
       Library and The GNU History Library for additional information.

		RETURN VALUE         top

       readline returns the text of the line read.  A blank line returns
       the empty string.  If EOF is encountered while reading a line,
       and the line is empty, NULL is returned.  If an EOF is read with
       a non-empty line, it is treated as a newline.
