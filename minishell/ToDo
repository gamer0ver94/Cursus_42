->int access(const char *pathname, int mode);
-access() checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname. If 
       pathname is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced. 

->int unlink(const char *pathname);
-unlink() deletes a name from the filesystem.  If that name was
       the last link to a file and no processes have the file open, the
       file is deleted and the space it was using is made available for
       reuse.
